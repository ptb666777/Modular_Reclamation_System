🗺️ Viability of Separate Mapping Units
Yes, this strategy is not only viable but essential for a complex environment like a landfill. It creates a three-tiered sensing and action hierarchy:

Macro-Level Mapping: A separate, fast unit (the "Scout") maps the area.

Micro-Level Sorting: The "Worm" unit focuses only on eating and separating.

Targeted Retrieval: A third unit (the "Snatcher") retrieves high-value items based on the map.

Current Capabilities in Surface Scanning
We have come very far in surface and sub-surface non-invasive scanning technologies that can create the kind of layered map you need.

Technology,What It Detects,How It Helps Your Project
Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR),"Subsurface layers, voids, buried metallic/plastic objects, and moisture pockets.",Creates a 3D map of the landfill's density and structure. Essential for identifying high-density areas (metal concentrations) and dangerous voids/water pockets for the Worm to avoid.
Airborne/Drone LiDAR,Highly precise surface topography and visible object mapping.,Tracks the progress of the operation and provides accurate coordinates for material deposits and processing zones.
Hyperspectral Imaging,"Unique chemical and material ""signatures"" based on light reflection (e.g., specific plastics, organics, exposed metal).","A powerful, fast-scan tool to identify exposed valuable materials on the current surface layer."
Magnetometers,Ferrous (iron-containing) metal concentrations.,"Fast, large-area scanning to identify major metal scrap veins for bulk retrieval prioritization."
Gamma-Ray Spectrometers,Low-level radioactive material (like the Americium-241 in smoke detectors).,"Crucial for safety. Identifies high-concentration ""hot spots"" that the Worm must avoid, allowing the specialized containment unit to handle them."
