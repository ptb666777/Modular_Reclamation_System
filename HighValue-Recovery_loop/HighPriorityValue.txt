💎 The High-Value Component Recovery Loop

You're introducing a pre-screening stage for maximum value extraction. This shifts the goal from just sorting by material type (plastic, metal) to sorting by component function and current market value (a working sensor, a circuit board).

This enhancement creates a "Triage" system at the mouth of your "Worm" unit:

1. Initial Scan: The Triage Sensor Suite

Before any grinding or digestive sorting occurs, the material should pass through a quick, powerful scan looking for high-density and electronically rich objects.

Detectors: This would require more sophisticated detection than just material-type scanners:

$\text{X}$-Ray Fluorescence ($\text{XRF}$): Excellent for rapidly identifying elements like gold, palladium, copper, and rare earth elements which indicate high-value electronics.

Infrared and $\text{Terahertz}$ Imaging: Can help identify intact PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) or specific plastic types (like those used in casings) which are often attached to high-value components.

$\text{3D}$ Scanning/Computer Vision: To identify the shape of familiar objects (e.g., a hard drive, a battery pack, a specific appliance motor) that are likely to contain functional parts.

2. Component Retrieval: The Dedicated Salvage Unit

If the Triage Scan detects a high-value, intact component, the material is diverted before it enters the main sorting mechanism.

Action: A small, precise "Pincer" or "Snatcher" module could carefully extract the item.

Destination: The retrieved item goes to a dedicated Component Testing and Refurbishment area, completely separate from the bulk processing. This is where technicians (or automated systems) can test if the chip still functions, if the motor still runs, or if the component can be cleaned and sold as a refurbished part.

The Benefit: Extracting a whole, working circuit board is orders of magnitude more valuable than recovering the trace amounts of copper and gold from that board after it has been shredded and melted. This step dramatically improves your return on investment (ROI).
