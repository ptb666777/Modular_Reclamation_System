🔄 Closing the Loop: Self-Sustaining Operations
This is the most impactful addition—using the recovered materials to sustain the operation itself.

1. Sourcing Repairs and New Constructions (Self-Sufficiency)
Metals and Plastics: All the metal alloys recovered can be used in your own small foundry to cast replacement parts for your swarm units (gears, casings, frames). Similarly, plastic resins can be injection-molded into replacement non-structural parts.
Electronics: Your component recovery provides a steady stream of low-cost spare parts (wires, resistors, sensors) for unit maintenance, reducing your reliance on external suppliers.

2. Integrated 3D Printing (The Manufacturing Hub)
Multi-Substrate Printers: Integrating printers that can handle metal powder (Additive Manufacturing), high-strength polymers, and even composite materials allows the facility to act as its own small-scale manufacturing hub.
Example: If a retrieval unit's sensor housing cracks, the processing unit can refine raw plastic waste into filament, and the integrated $\text{3D}$ printer can print a perfect replacement on-site.

By implementing internal material sourcing and manufacturing, you dramatically reduce your operating costs, minimize your external supply chain risk, and prove the ultimate viability of a closed-loop system. The project becomes a circular economy microcosm.
