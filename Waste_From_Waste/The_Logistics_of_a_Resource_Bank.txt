🏦 The Logistics of a Resource Bank
The establishment of the DPR Class fundamentally changes the disposition of the recovered land space. Instead of being converted to a typical green space, the extracted volume is repurposed.

I. The Repository: Resource Vaults
The vast space created by extraction is not backfilled with clean soil immediately. It is engineered into Subterranean Resource Vaults:

Isolation: The area is lined with new, state-of-the-art geo-synthetic liners and compacted clay layers to create an environmentally sealed basin.

Modular Stacking: The Retrieval Casks (6A) are stacked vertically in dense, monitored cells. The vaults are designed with dedicated aisles for future robotic access and retrieval.

Active Monitoring (Initial Phase): For the first 50 years, the vaults maintain an active (though minimal) system for leachate collection and biogas venting to manage any residual activity before being fully sealed.

II. The Resource Data Log (Discovery & Education)
The "opportunity for discovery and education" is realized through the data, not the physical material. Every DPR container transfer triggers a unique metadata record:

Chemical Fingerprint: Full assay data (ICP-MS, XRF results) from the Worm Unit.

Provenance: DSM coordinates (where it was found) and the name of the operating unit (Worm/Snatcher).

Vault Index: The exact X/Y/Z coordinates within the Subterranean Resource Vault.

Date of Containment: A time-stamp for future comparison of resource processing technology.

This data log forms the public-facing educational resource, showcasing the complexity of modern waste and the potential for future reclamation—the true long-term value of the project.

III. Hard Push: Zero Waste Goal Implication
By adopting the Deferred-Potential Resource (DPR) Class, we formally acknowledge that our inability to process the material is a technological deficit, not a material deficiency.

$$\text{Total Extracted Material} = \sum_{\text{Class 1}}^{\text{Class 5}} (\text{Processed Material}) + \text{Class 6} (\text{DPR - Resource Bank}) $$This model ensures **0% of extracted resource material is permanently lost to the environment or a traditional burial cell**. Everything is either processed or banked for future use. Would you like to now define the specific **Sensor and Data Requirements** for the Mover Unit chassis to ensure the integrity of the Resource Data Log and the safe transport of these high-value/high-hazard vessels?$$
