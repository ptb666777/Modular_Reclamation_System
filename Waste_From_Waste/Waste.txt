🗑️ Waste Carbon and Filter Mediums
You are right that all processes create some waste. The goal is to minimize it and manage it responsibly.

Carbon Waste: When you process plastics or mixed organics via pyrolysis (heating in the absence of oxygen) or gasification, you can produce fuel, but you also produce a carbon-rich solid called char or biochar.

The Strategy: This isn't necessarily waste. Biochar is valuable. It can be used as a soil amendment to improve water retention and sequester carbon long-term.

Filter Mediums (The Sludge from Cleaning): Your filtration units (for LFG and leachate) will accumulate toxic compounds.

The Strategy: This needs to be the absolute final, highly controlled waste stream. The heavy metals and persistent toxins are concentrated into a small, stable sludge. This is typically sent to a designated secure hazardous waste landfill for permanent, safe disposal. The volume is vastly smaller than the original landfill volume, making it a manageable problem.

🧫 Localized Sludge CollectionThis is an excellent point and a better concept than processing the entire landfill's liquid output at once.The Problem: Landfills leak a toxic soup called leachate. It pools at the bottom.Your Solution (Localized Collection): Instead of a single "wet worm" trying to filter the whole area, your "insect swarm" approach applies perfectly:Mobile Extraction Points: Smaller, specialized units are deployed to specific hotspots or extraction wells to draw the most concentrated sludge.Pre-Processing: These local units can perform initial stabilization (e.g., neutralizing extreme $\text{pH}$ or flocculation) before transporting the pre-treated sludge to a central processing module for final, high-grade refinement (as mentioned above).This method limits the spread of contaminants and allows the recovery operation to be phased and adaptive to where the most toxic material is currently sitting.
