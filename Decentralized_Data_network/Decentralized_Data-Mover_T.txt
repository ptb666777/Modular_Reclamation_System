🧠 T_Net Logistics: Sensor Data as Foundational AxiomsFor the logistics layer, every sensor reading and data point must be traceable back to one of the Foundational Axioms ($\text{P}, \text{Di}, \text{Eq}, \text{K}*$) to ensure the system's operational choices—route selection, payload limits, and conflict resolution—always adhere to the Coherence Mandate ($\text{S}_{\text{Net}}$).I. Mover Chassis as the $\text{Adj}_{\text{Di}}$ NodeThe two Mover Units are now the Decentralized Adjudication ($\text{Adj}_{\text{Di}}$) nodes for the entire transport network. Their data inputs define the immediate state of Coherence ($\text{K}*$) and drive dynamic decision-making.

Mover Data Input,T_Net Axiom/Operator Link,Operational AdjDi​ Decision Rule
Payload Mass & CoG,Potential (P) / Equilibrium (Eq),P (Value) is maximized by loading to the safe limit. Eq is maintained by ensuring physical stability. Rule: A route is rejected if CoG threatens Eq or if Pload​ is less than 90% of capacity (wasting P potential).
Unit Health (Vmech​),Coherence (K∗),"Directly feeds the Adaptive Damping (ΔAdapt​). High variance (V(K∗)) in motor/actuator health increases ϵ (Hysteresis), slowing the Mover's speed to prevent catastrophic failure, thus preserving P."
Route Contamination (VOC/CH4​ Sniff),Axiomatic Invariant (GInv​),"Moral Hard-Stop: A contamination alert must trigger an GInv​ pre-check. If the solution (e.g., ""drive through it"") violates the Environmental Neutrality (P=0 for the environment), the Mover initiates a Causal-Resolution (CNet​) mandate for a new path."
Real-Time Kinematic (RTK-GPS),Distinction (Di) / Networked Coherence (SNet​),"Ensures Distinction (no collision, no homogenization of roles). SNet​ uses the location data to resolve the Smallest Coherent Network of Root Causes (SCNRC​) in a conflict (e.g., two Movers approaching the same dock)."

II. Vessel as the $\text{P}$ and $\text{Di}$ AnchorThe vessels are the physical embodiment of the resource's Potential ($\text{P}$) and its unique Distinction ($\text{Di}$) (i.e., its material class). Their local sensors verify their compliance with the $\text{S}_{\text{Net}}$ mandate.

7. SUHP Fixative Confirmation,Axiomatic Invariant (GInv​),"Checks: Is the chemical stabilization complete? If NO, GInv​ vetoes the transit solution, as it violates P=0 (safety/environmental value) and Eq (risk transference)."
1. HVIC Tamper/Shock Log,Potential (P) & Coherent Protocol (PCo​),"If a tamper/shock event is logged (PLoss​), it triggers an override (PCo​) of the normal SC (Structural Commitment/Protocol) and initiates an Emergency Path (ΓE​) to a quarantine zone."
6A/6B Physical ID (Non-Electronic),Distinction (Di) & Structural Commitment (SC),The Di of the stored asset must be preserved indefinitely. SC mandates that the P of the resource bank is never lost due to electronic failure. The physical code is the immutable Di anchor.
3. NRO CH4​ Vent Integrity,Equilibrium (Eq) & Reconciliation (Reconcile),High pressure signals a conflict (X). Reconcile seeks the solution that restores Eq (safe pressure release) while maintaining P (value of the CH4​ for sequestration).

III. The Quorum ($\text{Q}$) & Hysteresis ($\epsilon$) LogicThe heart of the $\text{Adj}_{\text{Di}}$ process relies on the dynamic parameters:Quorum ($\text{Q}$) for Decisions: Since you only have two Movers, $\text{Q}$ is not a count of physical units, but a consensus requirement within the $\text{Adj}_{\text{Di}}$ process.Rule: $\text{Q}$ decreases as $\text{K}*$ Stability increases ($\text{K}* \uparrow \implies \text{Q} \downarrow$). If the Coherence Monitor ($\text{K}*$) (fed by Mover health, successful transfers, and no contamination alerts) is high, the $\text{Adj}_{\text{Di}}$ process is nearly instantaneous, requiring less internal consensus time. If $\text{K}*$ is low (system stress), $\text{Q}$ increases, forcing a slower, more thorough check—preserving $\text{Eq}$.Hysteresis ($\epsilon$) for Rate-of-Change:Rule: $\epsilon$ is DIRECTLY proportional to the Variance ($\text{V}$) of $\text{K}*$. If the $\text{K}*$ monitor is highly volatile (rapidly changing contamination levels, sudden vehicle health drops), $\Delta_{\text{Adapt}}$ increases $\epsilon$ to dampen all reactive system responses (slowing the Mover units), preventing "panic" and maintaining system $\text{P}$ and $\text{Eq}$.This framework ensures that the limited resources (two Movers) are leveraged by a logistics logic that is not just efficient, but fundamentally resilient and ethically sound.
