2 is a good path, 1. should be in the zip or at least the start.



we have a basic, 2 tracks, oxygen/biofuel feed power house in addition to a generator we can compress the exsost or run hydrolic pumps on demand.  the head segment with forward facing sensors and a mandabal small arms to manipulat chunks , clear debre to keep the bite pure, clear obstruction and what ever else, insects have verying gaw setups, but the samll arms seem to go with all of the chewers. each segment should have its own track and I was thinking like tremmers(movie), only not small spikes that wouldn't work. the segment movement may be able to also move bites thru each track and compress the output into pellets or tight bails where applical. In my original idea the wurm was producing clean ready to utilise matereals, but we moved away from that. redundancy, many of the same, is fine as segments operations could go offline and only act a a pass thru wile providing the motion for the tracks and movement. at the opening of the main input line for each will have a suit of sensors to inspect matereals, and systems to retrieve what ever that segment is specalised for. I think you can  evaluate a chain of extraction, but we need data analisis of what the percentages of the differnt matereals. I was also thinking the head could push things out of the way if it isn't able to chew or prosses. like a crushed car, a very large mixed matereal object that could more efficently be broken down. and may have high value parts, but didn't nessisarily qualify for high value extraction. possiblely for inbetween times of the high values targets. I am also wondering how we get the pellet payload to the surface. I'm unsure on the depth between the sealed layers, and we also dont want to punctur the bounderyies below.
