📝 Revised & Finalized Material Classes & Vessel SpecificationsBy introducing the SUHP (Class 7), we address the washing/transfer risk for the most dangerous materials. For all other classes, the goal is minimum-contact, automated washing integrated into the logistics cycle.The Standardized Washing LoopFor Classes 1, 2, 3, and 5, the vessel's journey is: Load $\rightarrow$ Transport $\rightarrow$ Unload $\rightarrow$ Automated Wash $\rightarrow$ Return to Service.Design for Washability: All BRS, NRO, and Leachate vessels will feature a smooth, non-porous, chemically-resistant internal lining (e.g., highly polished stainless steel or engineered polymer) with sloped floors and minimal internal seams/baffles to ensure no material is trapped.Washing System: The processing facility will use a standardized bay with high-pressure, closed-loop solvent/water jets and an integrated UV-C sanitation cycle to minimize water use and ensure cleanliness. The wash water then becomes part of the Leachate (Class 5) stream for treatment.

Class,Name,Key Purpose,Primary Material Integrity Feature
1.,High-Value Intact Components (HVIC) 💎,Theft/Damage Prevention,Electromagnetically Shielded & Fire Suppressed (Argon)
2.,Bulk Recyclable Solids (BRS) ♻️,"High-Volume, Fast Cycling",Perforated Drainage Floor & Quick-Dump Lock
3.,Non-Recyclable Organics (NRO) 🌱,Biogas Containment,Airtight Seal with Flame-Arrested Pressure Relief
5.,Bulk Contaminated Fluids (Leachate) 💧,Spill/Sloshing Prevention,Internal Baffles & Fully Pressure-Sealed Tanker
6A.,Bulk Complex Matrix (BCM) 🌟,"Indefinite, Retrievable Storage",Dual-Layer Composite & Embedded Physical Code
6B.,Trace Strategic Elements (TSE) 🌟,Archival Micro-Storage,Inert Gas Chamber & Lab-Ready Sub-Modules
7.,Single-Use Hazard Processor (SUHP) 🔥,Immediate Stabilization & Final Containment,Sacrificial Polymer Liner & Stabilization Injection Port

This refined catalogue ensures:

The highest hazard materials (SUHP) skip the washing cycle entirely, minimizing human/environmental risk.

The remaining high-volume vessels are purpose-built for efficient, automated decontamination.

The long-term resource bank (BCM, TSE) is robustly secured.

⛽ The $\text{BioFuel/O}_2$ & Battery Service Vessel (Class 8: The Tender)We will define a new, specialized vessel, Class 8, which serves as a Logistics Tender—a mobile support node that stage fuel, oxygen, and power near the Worm Units.

Specification Aspect,Detail & T_Net Rationale
Material Class,Class 8: Logistics Tender (TND) 🔋
Function,"Mobile Refueling and Power Staging: Stores purified Bio-Fuel, O2​ for the Worm, and a supply of charged, standardized battery packs for the Scout and Mover Units."
Integrity/Tank System,"Dual Containment: Features two separate, pressure-sealed tanks: one for Bio-Fuel (non-corrosive lining) and one for Compressed Oxygen (O2​)."
Battery Staging,"Secured, Insulated Bay: Includes racks for 10+ Standard Swappable Battery Modules with integrated temperature monitoring."
Autonomous Action,"Self-Extraction (Passive): While waiting (sitting idle), the vessel passively extracts and filters trace oxygen from the local air, compressing it into the O2​ tank using solar cells or a micro-generator connected to the small amount of Bio-Fuel it carries. Rationale: This utilizes idle time (P) to replenish O2​ stock, supporting Operational Independence and the Low-Cost mandate."
Mover Protocol,"The Mover Unit picks up the empty TND vessel from the Worm area, takes it to the BMF (Bio-Fuel fill, O2​ top-off) and the MMRH (Battery swap), and then returns the charged TND to the next anticipated work area."

This addition streamlines the logistics chain, ensures the Worm always has its necessary power components and oxygen for subterranean operation, and perfectly utilizes idle time.
