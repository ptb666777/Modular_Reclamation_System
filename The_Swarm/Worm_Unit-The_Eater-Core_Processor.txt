Role: Bulk material ingestion and primary multi-stage separation.

Key Design: Segmented, modular body allows for upgrades and repairs.

Process Flow: Material is lightly shredded/crushed (only as necessary), then passed through specialized segments using magnetic separation, trommel screening, and density/optical sorting.

Output: Four primary, separated material streams (Metals, Plastics, Organics, Inert).


🐛 The Worm Unit: Segmented Digestion & Processing
Your concept of a segmented, multi-stage processing track is highly viable and offers significant advantages:

Modular Improvement: Each segment becomes a specialized component (a "stomach" or "filter") that can be upgraded or swapped out without halting the entire operation. This future-proofs the system against new recycling technologies.

Contamination Control: Using space between "bites" and having segregated internal tracks for the material and the extracted product prevents cross-contamination, leading to cleaner, higher-value recovered resources.

Redundancy: If one segment fails, it can be bypassed or taken offline for repair while other segments continue working, minimizing downtime.

1. The Shredding Dilemma: Powdering vs. Bulk Sorting
You are right: Powdering is often unnecessary and wastes energy. It should be avoided unless absolutely required for separation or volume reduction.

The strategy must be: Minimal Mechanical Reduction is Best.

Material Stream,Recommended Initial Reduction,Justification
Bulk Metals,Coarse Shredding / Crushing,"Reduction is necessary for size uniformity, freeing non-metal inclusions, and safe handling by magnetic/eddy current separators."
"High-Density Plastics (HDPE, PET)",Granulation / Flaking,"Reduction to uniform flakes is necessary for washing, drying, and subsequent optical sorting by color/resin type."
"Organics (Diapers, Food)",Pulping / Slurrying,Reduction to a pumpable slurry is required for efficient feeding into the Anaerobic Digester (AD) for methane production.
"Inert Materials (Concrete, Glass)",Crushing / Screening,Crushing allows separation by size and use of trommels (large spinning screens) to separate fine cover soil from larger debris.
High-Value Components,None,Avoid all mechanical stress. These are extracted whole by the Snatcher Unit to preserve their function and value.

The "bite" taken by the Worm should only be crushed or shredded just enough to break up the dense landfill matrix and expose the interior materials for the first stage of sorting.

2. Stages of Separation (The Digestive Tract)
The length of the Worm allows for an extended series of sophisticated separation techniques. The material passes through the primary input track, and at each stage, a specialized segment pulls out a targeted material stream.

Stage (Segment),Separation Technology,Target Output
Stage 1: Bulk Separation,Trommel Screening / Air Classification,Output 1: Fine Soil/Cover Material (Used for site capping/rehabilitation). Output 2: Light Organics/Textiles (Directed toward the Organics Processor).
Stage 2: Ferrous Metal Extraction,Overband Magnets & Drum Magnets,"Output 3: Ferrous Metals (Iron, Steel) (Sent to a bulk vessel). This is the easiest material to pull out."
Stage 3: Non-Ferrous Metal Extraction,Eddy Current Separators (ECS),"Output 4: Non-Ferrous Metals (Aluminum, Copper) (Requires careful, clean collection vessel)."
Stage 4: Plastic & Inert Separation,Density Separation (Float/Sink Tanks),"Output 5: Plastics (Separated based on specific density, e.g., PET sinks, PE floats). Output 6: Inert Heavy Material (Rocks, dense ceramics)."
Stage 5: Final Material Polishing,Optical Sorting / Near-Infrared (NIR) Detectors,"Final verification and separation of remaining mixed materials (e.g., sorting plastics by resin type or color before pelletizing)."

3. Output Track & Pelleting
Your idea for a separate, downstream Output Track where products are prepared is perfect.

Temporary Buffer: Extracted materials (like clean copper scrap or sorted plastic flakes) are stored in temporary reservoirs within the Worm segment until a Specialized Vessel (from our next planned fork) is ready at the surface to receive it.

Pelletizing/Compaction: Yes, once the material is confirmed clean, it should be processed for transport:

Metals: Baled or Compacted into high-density cubes.

Plastics: Melted or Squeezed into Pellets/Flakes for ease of storage and sale to manufacturers.

Soil/Inert: Compressed into uniform blocks for site construction or final safe capping.

This segmented design makes the Worm Unit the intelligent heart of your processing line, fulfilling its mandate without unnecessary, energy-intensive over-shredding.

The Worm Unit (The Eater) (Value Assignment: $\text{Di}$ & $\text{Reconcile}$) 🐛The Worm is an interconnected, segmented system.

Specification Aspect,Detail & T_Net Rationale
Form Factor,Segmented Assembly Line: Articulated train structure (Digestion → Sorting → Discharge). Constraint: All segments are designed for quick install/removal by the Fixer Unit.
Power Source,"External Power Tap: Operates solely on purified electric power supplied via heavy-duty umbilical cord from the Biogas/Power Hub. Rationale: Adheres to the ""no unpurified burning"" constraint and maximizes P by centralizing energy management."
Self-Repair,Zero On-Board Printing: Relies entirely on the Fixer Unit and the inventory of reclaimed parts from the Manufacturing Hub.

The move away from the umbilical cord and towards internal power is essential for subterranean movement.

Subterranean Mobility: The Worm's segmented body must be driven by actuators designed for peristaltic movement—utilizing segments to "squeeze" material backward and propel itself forward, mimicking an earthworm's movement.

This action simultaneously compacts material and feeds the digestive tract.

Power Source Solution: Liquid Methane (LCH 
4
​
 )

Feasibility: Yes, purified methane (CH 
4
​
 ) can be liquefied at cryogenic temperatures (−161.5 
∘
 C). Cryogenic storage is complex but feasible for an on-board engine.

Revised System: The Worm is powered by a small, high-efficiency LCH 
4
​
  engine/turbine. The fuel is purified, liquefied, and transferred from the Bio and Methane Facility to the Worm's cryogenic on-board tank by the Mover Unit (carrying a specialized LCH 
4
​
  tanker vessel). This fully supports the Environmental Neutrality constraint (no burning of unpurified gas) and grants the Worm full subterranean independence.
