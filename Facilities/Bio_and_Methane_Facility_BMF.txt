Function: Captures, purifies, and utilizes landfill gas ($\text{LFG}$) for system power.Gas Transport: Uses semi-permanent, internal taps connecting to the Worm's excavation site. The gas is drawn via mobile pump stations (non-Mover Units) and piped to the $\text{BMF}$.Core Processes:Gas Purification: Extensive scrubbing to remove contaminants ($\text{H}_2\text{S}$, $\text{CO}_2$) before use.Energy Generation: High-efficiency fuel cells or turbines running on purified $\text{CH}_4$ to generate the grid power for all facilities and the Mover battery chargers.Liquefaction: Cryogenic system to produce $\text{LCH}_4$ fuel for the mobile Worm Units, ensuring self-sufficiency.
