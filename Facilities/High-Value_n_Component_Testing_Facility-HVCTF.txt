 🔬 High-Value & Component Testing Facility (HVCTF)Function: Handles low-volume, high-value, and complex items requiring cleanroom conditions. Houses the Library Catalog.Input Streams: $\text{HVIC}$ (Class 1) and complex $\text{BCM}$ (Class 6A) requiring advanced disassembly.Core Processes:Component Testing: In-depth diagnostics, cleaning, and verification of working electronics (chips, motors, sensors). Items are held for immediate use (internal repair) or certified for high-value sale.Deconstruction: Non-working $\text{HVIC}$ is systematically broken down into its purest elements (metals, rare earths) for the $\text{TSE}$ stream ($\text{P}$ maximization).Library Catalog: The secured physical storage of the $\text{TSE}$ (Class 6B) archive modules and the associated full chemical assay data ($\text{Di}$).
