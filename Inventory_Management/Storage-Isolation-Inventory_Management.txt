🏗️ Storage, Isolation, and Inventory Management
You are addressing the challenge of trace contaminants and the importance of secure inventory before processing.

1. Containment and Isolation (The Hazardous Trace Elements)
You are correct that some materials require specialized handling, particularly radioactive materials (like the americium-241 in some smoke detectors) or highly toxic elements (like mercury or cadmium).

The Strategy: Isolate and Concentrate. These high-risk, low-volume materials must be immediately separated by the "Worm" Triage system and placed into specialized, shielded containment units.

The Benefit: While initial processing may be slow, isolating these elements prevents them from contaminating the larger, more valuable material streams (like metal or plastic scrap). These elements are valuable in small, controlled amounts: for instance, Americium is used in industrial gauges. By concentrating them, you turn a wide-spread toxic contaminant into a controlled, high-value raw material for niche industries.

2. Processing and Reduction (The Long-Term Project)
You suggest reducing these materials further, which is critical for long-term storage and ultimate marketability.

Radioactive Reduction: This is a very specialized, decades-long field. For items like Americium, you'd be looking at highly controlled chemical processing to extract the radioisotope and then converting the material into a chemically stable, solid form for storage or sale. This becomes a slow, specialized back-log inventory.

Mercury/Cadmium: Processing here means thermal treatment (retorts) to safely vaporize and then condense the toxic metals into a pure liquid or solid state, making them suitable for reuse in batteries or controlled manufacturing.

3. The Final Inventory: A Resource Catalogue
By isolating and stabilizing these elements, you create a diverse "catalogue of inventory." Your processing area isn't just selling bales of plastic; it's selling:

High-Volume Commodities: Cleaned ferrous metals, PET plastic pellets.

Refurbished Components: Tested CPU chips, working motors.

Niche Feedstocks: Purified mercury, concentrated Americium pellets.
